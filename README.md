# bo-Pi
This package allows to use a Raspberry Pi as simple robotic platform. In my implementaiton I used the Boe-Bot frame from Parallax.

I took care to design a clean user interface based on Foundation from Zurb and to structure the Node.js program according to best pracctices so teh software is easy to maintain or expanded and can be reused for other, mre advanced roboti projects.

I also included Openscad files for the connecitons with the Boe-Bot frame (/doc/hardware). Please consider this is meant to be a simple platform to experiment with robots and JavaScripts so the parts are very simple.

Next steps
- add sensors to the robot
- logging on database
- computer vision
- provide connecitons schematics
