# bo-Pi
This package allows to use a Raspberry Pi with the Boe-Bot frame.

I took care to design a clean user interface based on Foundation from Zurb and to structure the Node.js program according to best pracctices so teh software is easy to maintain or expanded and can be reused for other, mre advanced roboti projects.

Next steps
- add sensors to the robot
- logging on database
- computer vision
